print-for printing stuff
print("helloworld")
variable name
var 1= "python"
print("good morning",var1)
name=input("Enter your name")
name is a variable ; we store stuff in variable
we are taking input from user by using input
fstring- formatted string 
age=20
name=anagha
print(f"hello )
maps are used for taking input once and for ALL
name="hello"
print(name,end=" ")
print(name)
end is used for formatting desired output formatt
f string-formatted string


conditional statements:

checking the conditions of the statements
if,else if,else,nested if and nested elif


control statements

controls the whole program

operators-unary,binary
2 or more operands
unary-operation on single operands
arithmetic,assignment,logical,bitwise,ternary,relational
arithmetic  : add,sub,mul,div,mod(used for huge input)



********binary search**********very important 


operators math module-power operator.
2**5=32

logical operator-
logical AND- only if both conditions is true
logical OR- if one condition is true , result is true

1)PROBLEM 1
if(18-24)-2 wheeler
if(24-45)-2,4 wheeler
if(45-60)-2,4,6 wheeler


2)PROBLEM 2
x goes to market-buys 10 apples,24 bananas,8 oranges
the cost of 1 apple is 15 rupees
banana-4 rupees
orange-5 rupees

mother of x -mrs your
y gave x 700 rupees and buy everything

if the remaining amount matches - shopkeeper is innocent
else the shopkeeper deceived x



3) PROBLEM 3 
if num is even and positive
positive even




4)PROBLEM 4
mr z is selected for olympics. 
he is participating in swimming ......only one winner will be selected.
z is selected. z has friends named x,your
x participates in shuttle
y participates in table tennis
according to selection committee, the requirements of badminton players are
1)h: 140 cm
2)w:factors of 2
3)bodyfat:<12%
according to selection committee, the requirements of table tennis are
1)h:118-148 cm
2)w: factors of no of medals won by mr z
3)body fat=14%
according to previous history, z partcipated in 14 games , out of which he is having success rate of 65%

write a program to check x,y,z travel in same plane or not

ARRAY

->collection of homogenous elements/data types----TO USE ARRAYS in python we need to use numpy;
continuous memory location;important numpy

LIST

->collection of heterogenous elements; continuous memory allocation;list is mutable
append,slicing allowed

TUPLE

->INSTA DATA is stored in TUPLE;insta backend code is in python(DJANGO);tuple is immutable; many crucial information like aadhar num are using tuples
slicing not allowed
indexing allowed
information which cannot be altered use tuple 

SETS

->sets are unordered; (which is major disavantage)
sets cannot be used to reorder
cannot allow duplicate values(order of duplicates is not preserved)

DICTIONARY

->key value pair
in advanced versions they are mutable; and key is immutable and values are mutable





hw
1)prime num or not
square root method
n/2 method(for loop)
2)palindrome or not
3)check if given num is armstrong or not
4)check if given num is friendly num or not
5)check if given num is strong or not
6)find sum of first n natural numbers
